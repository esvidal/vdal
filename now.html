        <h2>TESTING YOURGROUPS</h2>
        <p>
        Currently testing a web app called <a href="https://yourgroups.com">YourGroups</a>.
        If you are interested, sign up and create a group. 
        Tell me what you think.
        <!-- 
            Add a link to a new page featuring documentation of my testing.
            I have this idea of logs of an issue.
            Describing not so much the details be the thinking about a feature.
            Lets say a bug about passwordless sign up.
            With a feature like that, I would have a lot of exploration about the feature.
            And how others use it.

        You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
        It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
        Just write inside an HTML file directly! 
        So much simpler.
        <p>
        You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
        <p>
        Or insert an image like this:
        <img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
        <p>
        That's it!
